# 🇬🇧 English Interview Practice Script

 
#### Introduction 
> Okay, let’s start!  
> when you don’t practice, you forget a few things.
<br> One of my _main goals_ is _to work on_ an international project — to keep improving my English skills.
<br> I can handle most work situations in English — reading, understanding business rules, and discussing technical topics.
<br> Back in 2023, I went to Europe — one of my goals was to practice my English. 
<br> i visited London.
<br> That same year, I also had the opportunity to be part of a team that included some English colleagues.
<br> In that project, I was involved in several business decisions, mainly because I was the Tech Lead

> I live in Itajaí, Its a coastal city in southern Brazil.  
> In my free time, I love going to the beach, exploring new places, and spending time with my family.  
> Cycling is my favorite sport — it’s how I stay active and recharge my batteries
--- 
#### Academic Background
> I graduated in Information Systems, and later I completed two postgrad courses in IT — one in Software Engineering and 
> another focused on Java for Web development.
---
#### background de trabalho 

> Pagseguro
<br> Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at PagSeguro, which is a digital payment company.
<br> IN THE BACKEND side
<br> Besides development and coding, I also participate in important technical decisions, review my teammates’ code, and contribute to system architecture.
<br> We have around ten applications written in Kotlin and java, and my main role is to implement solutions based on business needs.
<br> We hold business meetings, refinement sessions, and technical discussions to define the best approaches for implementation.

> Lately, I’ve been working a lot on infrastructure-related tasks.
> Recently, I’ve been involved in adapting PagSeguro’s CI pipelines, as we’re migrating from AWS to PagSeguro’s private cloud.
> All deployments are done in Kubernetes (K8s).

> So, to summarize, I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer handling business-driven demands, 
> participating in development refinements with my teammates, and also managing infrastructure tasks — such as Kubernetes deployments, 
> services, and ingress manifests — basically everything related to running our applications in K8s.

> My daily routine at PagBank basically involves attending daily meetings, participating in technical refinement sessions for new features, 
> deploying applications to staging and production environments, and investigating production issues whenever they occur.
> 
> I work in the account security domain.
> My team is responsible for password matching and password recovery processes.
> In addition to business and infrastructure tasks, I also investigate production issues through application monitoring and log analysis.

#### Falar um pouquinho sobre outras atividades como sou dev, teach lead e arquiteto de software
> I’ve had experience as a developer, tech lead, and architect, and I really enjoy all three roles. 
> As a developer, I like being hands-on — coding in Java and Kotlin, solving problems, and making services faster and more reliable. 
> Besides development, I also take care of the delivery side — adjusting pipelines in Jenkins, improving CI/CD steps, 
> managing deployments, and configuring Kubernetes. 
> I spend a good amount of time looking at logs, traces, dashboards, and overall observability to keep the systems healthy and reliable.
> As a tech lead, I enjoy helping the team, unblocking people, and making sure we’re aligned on good practices and clean design. 
> And as an architect, I focus on the bigger picture — building scalable, resilient solutions and making decisions that keep the system healthy over time.
> What I like the most is being flexible. If the team needs me coding, I code. If they need guidance, I jump in and support. 
> If they need someone thinking about architecture and trade-offs, I’m comfortable doing that too. 
> I like working in a collaborative environment, helping people grow, and making sure we deliver something solid together.”
>

#### Relevant Projects
> Every project comes with its own challenges, particularities, and unique aspects.
<br> I can say I have some preferences, such as working with the latest versions of Java and Kotlin.
<br> I also prefer using the most up-to-date versions of the Spring Boot framework.
<br> I enjoy working with distributed systems because an application should be available, scalable, performant, and resilient.

#### Challenges Faced
> “One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced was leading a migration from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture.  
> We had to ensure data consistency, resilience, and minimal downtime.  
> It required mentoring the team, choosing the right technologies, and keeping alignment with business goals — all under tight
> deadlines.  
> It was tough, but it taught me a lot about leadership and system design.”
---
#### Career Goals
> “My main goal is to continue evolving as a software architect and help teams build **scalable, maintainable, and resilient
> systems**.  
> I’m also passionate about sharing knowledge — through mentoring, writing documentation, and improving engineering practices.”
---
#### Why Do You Want to Work Here?
> i decided that could a great opportunity professional to work in 
---
#### Thanking the Interviewer
> “Thank you very much for your time and the opportunity to discuss my background and experience. 
---    
#### How Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?
> I don’t worry much about that. 
> I just try to keep up with new tech and software architecture trends. 
> But one of my goals is definitely to work with people from different countries. to improve my communication skills
---
#### Strengths and Weaknesses
> “My main strength is problem-solving — I stay calm under pressure, analyze issues carefully, and focus on finding effective
> solutions.  
> I’m also very detail-oriented and committed to code quality.
>
> As for weaknesses, I sometimes take too much responsibility because I want everything to go perfectly.  
> I’ve been working on delegating more and trusting others to take ownership as well.”
---
#### Technical Challenge Example
> “One technical challenge I faced was dealing with **event ordering issues in a Kafka-based system**.  
> Messages were arriving out of order, which caused data inconsistencies.  
> To solve it, I introduced a unique reference ID for each message and implemented logic to ensure the correct correlation between input
> and output events.  
> This approach improved consistency and allowed the system to handle multiple parallel requests safely.”

#### [TAG Backend & Architecture] HIGH LEVEL
> # Arquitetura de Software (nível macro, decisões estruturais)
>
> when we talk about software architecture, we can divide it into three main areas:
> ### 1 - Distribution Styles, 
> ### 2 - Internal Organization Styles and 
> ### 3 - Integration Styles
>
> ### 1 - Distribution Styles (how I divide the system into applications/services)
> Monolith (or Modular Monolith)
> Pros and cons: simple to develop, test, and deploy; difficult to scale and maintain as it grows.
>
> SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture): larger services sharing contracts; usually more tightly coupled than microservices.
> Pros and cons: simplifies integration with legacy systems; can lead to bottlenecks and complexity with an ESB.
>
> Microservices: small, independent services aligned with bounded contexts (DDD).
> Note: bounded contexts are parts of the domain that have their own language and model, 
> and can be implemented as separate microservices.
> Pros and cons: improves scalability and maintainability; more complex to develop, test, and deploy.
>
> Serverless: functions or containers managed by a cloud provider, paying only for usage.
> Pros and cons: reduces infrastructure overhead; may have execution limits and vendor lock-in.
>
---
> ### 2 - Internal Organization Styles (how I structure each application, whether monolith or microservice)
> Layered Architecture: presentation → domain → infrastructure/data.
> Clean Architecture structures software into concentric layers, ensuring that business rules remain independent of frameworks, databases, and the user interface.
> Hexagonal Architecture — also known as Ports and Adapters — takes a more pragmatic approach, emphasizing clear separation between contracts (ports) and their implementations (adapters).
> Both architectures share the same core principle: keeping business logic at the heart of the system, while pushing technical details to the outer layers.
> 
---
> ### 3 - Integration Styles (how parts communicate)
> Synchronous via API:
> REST, gRPC, GraphQL (API-Driven).
> → gRPC is a remote communication framework developed by Google that uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protobuf for data serialization.
> → Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) is an efficient and compact data serialization format used to define the structure of messages exchanged between services.
> 
> Asynchronous via Messaging / Event-Driven:
> Kafka, RabbitMQ, SNS/SQS (pub/sub, event-carried state transfer, CQRS + Event Sourcing as optional patterns).
> 
> Modelos de execução/implantação (onde/como rodam) 
> Containers & Orquestração: Docker + Kubernetes (microservices ou monólitos containerizados). 
> Serverless – FaaS: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions (funções). 
> Serverless – Containers: Cloud Run, AWS App Runner (containers sem gerenciar servidores). 
> BaaS (quando aplicável): Cognito/Auth0, Firebase, etc. (terceiriza capabilities).

#### [TAG SPRING]
Spring Boot accelerates backend development in Java, and Spring Cloud helps manage distributed microservices.

🔵 Spring Core <br>
It’s like a box of LEGO pieces: everything is there, but you assemble everything manually. <br>
It provides the fundamentals: IoC, Dependency Injection, ApplicationContext, AOP, and the base for MVC. <br>

🟢 Spring Boot <br>
It’s like pre-assembled LEGO: most of the heavy lifting is already done. <br>
It reduces boilerplate and loads automatic configurations based on the dependencies you add. <br>

🟣 Spring Starters <br>
They are ready-made kits that bundle related dependencies. <br>
When you include a starter, Spring Boot knows exactly which configurations to load for you. <br>

💬 Professional Summary of My Experience with Spring <br>
I work with the full Spring ecosystem. <br>
In Spring Core, I use modules such as spring-core, spring-context, spring-aop, and spring-webmvc, 
which provide IoC, DI, and the foundation of the MVC model. <br>
With Spring Boot, I rely on starters like Web, Data JPA, Security, and Actuator to simplify configuration. <br>
I understand that starters are dependency bundles that automatically configure Spring Core modules. <br>
I also work with Spring Cloud to build microservices with distributed configuration, service discovery, 
resilience, and scalable communication. <br>

## [TAG JAVA] 
> Build & Dependency Management (Maven, Gradle) 
**Q:** Which build tools do you use?  
**A:** I’ve used both Maven and Gradle. At PagSeguro, most Kotlin projects use Gradle because it’s faster and easier to configure. For older Java projects, I still maintain Maven builds. I like keeping dependencies well-managed and versioned.

> Programming Languages (Java, Kotlin) 
**Q:** Which language do you prefer, Java or Kotlin?  
**A:** I’m comfortable with both, but Kotlin is my favorite for backend development — it’s concise, expressive, and reduces boilerplate code. Still, I appreciate Java’s stability and ecosystem. I switch between them easily depending on the project.

#### [TAG TESTING] Understanding Testing in Backend Development
> When we talk about testing, we can actually be referring to several different types of tests within backend development.
>
> We might be talking about unit tests, where we test individual components or functions in isolation. These tests make sure that each small part of the system works as expected.
> In Java, for example, we often use frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to create and execute unit tests. JUnit provides the structure for writing the tests, while Mockito helps us mock dependencies, simulating external behavior without needing to connect to real services or databases.
>
> We can also be referring to integration tests. Unlike unit tests, these validate how different parts of the system work together — for example, how a service interacts with a database, or how two microservices communicate through an API. Integration testing ensures that the system behaves correctly as a whole.
>
> Another important type is stress testing (or load testing). These tests check how the system behaves under heavy load — for instance, when thousands of users try to access the same resource at the same time. Stress tests are essential to verify scalability, performance, and resilience, ensuring the system can handle real-world traffic without failures.
>
> We can also talk about mocked tests or simulated tests, often implemented with tools like WireMock. This approach is useful when we want to test interactions with external systems or APIs that are not available or are expensive to call in real time. WireMock lets us create fake endpoints that return predefined responses, allowing consistent and repeatable testing scenarios.
>
> In summary, testing in backend development is not just about checking if the code works — it’s about ensuring reliability, maintainability, and confidence in the software.
> A good testing strategy usually combines multiple levels of testing — unit, integration, system, and performance — to cover the system from the smallest function to the most complex real-world scenario.

#### [TAG CI/CD] jenkis etc
> about
<br> **Q:** How do you handle CI/CD in your team?  
<br> **A:** We use Jenkins for our CI/CD pipelines. Every commit triggers automatic builds, tests, and deployments.
<br> We follow a multistage pipeline approach — from QA to production — ensuring every change passes all validations before going live.
<br> CI and CD are ways to deliver code automatically.
<br> there are some tools available.
<br> Right now, I work with Jenkins. I’ve also used Jenkins in other companies before.
<br> But there are other options, like Bitbucket, GitHub Actions, and Azure Pipelines. all of them are good options. 
 
> Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that code changes are automatically tested.
<br> Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release of new features.
<br> DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations.
<br> Observability helps us understand the system’s behavior in production.
<br> Scalability means the system can handle increasing traffic.
<br> Resilience ensures recovery from failures.
<br> Load balancing distributes traffic evenly among servers.
<br> Fault tolerance allows the system to keep working even if one part fails.
<br> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) lets us manage servers using versioned scripts.
<br> We use a service mesh to handle communication between microservices.
>
## [TAG CLOUD]  
> Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP, Azure)
**Q:** What’s your experience with cloud environments?  
**A:** I mainly work with AWS, using services like S3, SQS, and ECR for our deployments. But we also operate in a private cloud called PagCloud, which makes us a multicloud environment. I like this setup because it gives flexibility and resilience.
>
## [TAG KUBERNETES]  
> Containerization & Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes) 
**Q:** Do you have experience with Docker or Kubernetes?  
**A:** Yes, I use Docker for building and packaging our applications, and we deploy everything on Kubernetes. I usually define deployments, services, and ingress configurations in YAML. I’ve also worked with blue-green and rollout deployment strategies.

## [TAG INVILLIA] 
1. If you had to choose between RabbitMQ and Kafka for a new system, what criteria would you consider?<br>
Which scenarios favor each technology and why? <br>
Also explain the main differences between queues and topics in messaging systems.<br>

When I need to choose between RabbitMQ and Kafka, I first: <br>
- look at the type of communication the system needs 
- and the message volume. 
- I also consider whether the team needs to reprocess events, what the expected latency is, 
and how the consumers are supposed to work.

**RabbitMQ** is great when the system follows a more “do this now” style — tasks and commands. 
- It delivers fast, supports message-level ACKs, and offers flexible routing. 
- It works really well when each message needs to go to a single consumer, and the overall volume isn’t extreme.

**Kafka** shines in high-volume scenarios, especially when the system is event-driven and needs to store messages for longer. 
- It allows multiple consumers to read the same event, keeps ordering within partitions, and makes reprocessing very easy. 
- That’s usually my choice for more complex asynchronous integrations or event-driven observability.

The main difference between a queue and a topic is simple:
- A queue sends each message to one consumer — it’s work distribution.
- A topic lets multiple consumers read the same message — it’s event broadcasting.

3. What metrics do you consider essential to monitor in a microservices environment?<br>
   How would you implement observability?<br>
   What tools have you worked with before?

To monitor microservices, I track four essential categories of metrics:
- Infrastructure metrics: CPU, memory, GC activity, thread usage, and container limits.
- Application metrics: p95/p99 latency, error rates, throughput, dependency latency (database, Kafka, REST), 
  and connection-pool behavior.
- Messaging metrics: Kafka consumer lag, queue size, production/consumption rate, DLQ volume, and retries.
- Business metrics: processed orders/events, conversion rates, rule rejections, and end-to-end processing time.

These metrics allow me to monitor not only whether the service is “running,” but whether the business flow is actually healthy.

For observability, I implement the full triad:
- Structured logs with traceId, spanId, correlationId, and consistent JSON formatting.
- Metrics using Micrometer exporting to Prometheus, visualized in Grafana (or equivalent).
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry to follow the entire lifecycle of a request across services.

I’ve worked with ELK, Splunk, New Relic, Datadog, CloudWatch, and Pagmon, as well as Kafka and RabbitMQ 
dashboards for analyzing lag, offsets, and consumer behavior.

This combination gives me the ability to detect bottlenecks, understand business impact, and react quickly during incidents.

4. In a distributed system where two microservices communicate via Kafka, how would you structure that communication?

When we implement asynchronous communication to solve a problem, we can easily introduce new problems if we're not careful. <br>
So before designing anything with Kafka, I first think about the risks I want to avoid.<br>
I need to predict some risks I want to avoid<br>
And what would be the main problems I want to prevent when two microservices communicate through Kafka?

Message loss or duplication
- A producer may send the event, but the consumer might not process it — or process it twice.

Event ordering
- Some scenarios must keep the order per entity, like all events for the same customerId or orderId.

Idempotency and reprocessing
- If I need to reprocess a topic or Kafka redelivers the same message, the consumer can’t break the system state.

Contract coupling
- If the payload schema changes, I can’t afford to break every consumer.<br>
That’s why event versioning is important.

Backpressure / speed mismatch
- Producers can publish much faster than consumers can handle.

Error handling
- What do I do with messages that always fail? I need a proper retry strategy and a DLQ.

Observability
- I need to answer: What happened to this event? Did it fail? Who consumed it? Where did it stop?

Security and isolation
- Controlling who can publish and consume each topic.

If I ignore these points, the architecture might work fine in the happy path, but it will become 
a real source of pain in production.

Second: How I would structure the communication between the two microservices using Kafka

To minimize these risks, I’d structure the solution like this:
- Define clear domain events and contracts<br>
- No generic payloads. I’d use explicit events like CustomerCreatedEvent, OrderApprovedEvent, etc.<br>
And I’d use JSON or Avro with a well-defined, versioned schema.
- Topic modeling and keying strategy<br>
I’d create domain-oriented topics such as: customer-events or orders-events.<br>
And I’d use the entity ID (customerId, orderId) as the message key to maintain partition ordering.

- Add important metadata to each event
Things like: eventId (UUID), eventType, correlationId, sourceService, timestamp<br>
This helps with tracking, debugging, and idempotency.

Resilient producer<br>
Service A publishes to the topic with:
- Proper acks
- Retry with backoff
- And for critical cases, I’d use the Outbox pattern so the event is only published after the local transaction succeeds.

Idempotent consumer
- Service B consumes in a consumer group, allowing horizontal scaling.
- Processing must be idempotent: Use eventId or a referenceId and Keep a record of processed events 
to avoid duplicating effects

Structured retry and DLQ
- If processing fails due to a temporary issue:
- Send it to a retry topic with backoff (e.g., orders-events.retry)
- If it fails permanently (bad payload, rule violation):
- Move it to a DLQ (e.g., orders-events.dlq) for manual or specific processing.

Observability
Track metrics like:
- Consumer lag
- Error rate
- Consumption/production rate
- And log with correlationId and eventId, ideally using distributed tracing to connect HTTP requests → Kafka events → consumers.

Security and governance
- Use Kafka ACLs to define who can publish/consume.
- Follow a clear naming convention for topics to simplify governance.

5. Explique como você projetaria um banco de dados para um sistema de alta escala. Quando optaria por SQL vs NoSQL?

When I design a database for a high-scale system, I don’t start with “SQL vs NoSQL.” I start with the requirements.

First, I look at the data model and the domain — how the entities relate, whether the structure is complex or 
more aggregate-based.

Then I consider the access patterns — is the system read-heavy or write-heavy, do we query mostly by ID, 
or do we need filters, reports, and joins?

I also check the non-functional requirements — data volume, expected latency, availability, and the level of 
consistency the business needs.

For high scale, I focus on a few pillars:<br>
- a data model aligned to the use cases,
- well-planned indexing and partitioning,
- and replication plus caching (like Redis) to offload the database during traffic spikes.

The idea is that scalability comes from the model + access patterns + infrastructure — not just from picking SQL or NoSQL.

When would I choose SQL?<br> 
- SQL is my choice when I need strong consistency, ACID transactions, and the domain has rich relationships 
and complex rules — things like financial flows, orders, limits, or anything that depends heavily on integrity and joins.

In short: when the business needs highly consistent, well-related data, SQL is usually the right fit.

When would I choose NoSQL? <br>
- I’d pick NoSQL when I’m dealing with massive data volume and need easier horizontal scaling.
- It fits well when the model is aggregate/document-oriented, when I need flexible schema evolution, 
and when the system can tolerate eventual consistency in exchange for low latency and high availability.

In short: when the focus is large scale, flexible schema, and simple access patterns, NoSQL is a strong choice.

8. Imagine que precisamos criar um ecommerce com alta demanda. 
Esporadicamente vamos realizar campanhas televisivas que gerarão acessos elevados em determinados momentos. 
A busca de nosso ecommerce também será bastante requisitada, sendo que muitos usuários pesquisam pelo 
mesmo produto várias vezes ao dia.
Como você estruturaria este projeto visando resolver os problemas relatados? 
Lembre-se que precisamos garantir escalabilidade, resiliência e rapidez.

- For a high-demand ecommerce with traffic spikes caused by TV campaigns, I would focus on CDN, 
caching, stateless services, and distributed processing.

- First, I’d place a CDN in front of all static content and use an API Gateway with rate limiting 
and horizontal scalability through Kubernetes.

- The architecture would be microservices-based, so I can scale the components that 
actually suffer pressure — mainly catalog and search.

- For search, I’d use Elasticsearch / OpenSearch and put Redis in front to cache repeated queries, 
since many users search for the same products multiple times a day.

- For data, I’d keep the catalog in its own database (SQL or NoSQL) and orders in a relational database 
with read replicas to spread the load.
Heavy or external operations (payment, antifraud, emails) would be decoupled using messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) 
to avoid bottlenecks during peak traffic.

- To ensure resilience, I’d apply timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, DLQs, and 
graceful degradation — prioritizing search and checkout over secondary features during TV-campaign peaks.

- Finally, I’d make everything observable with metrics (latency, errors, throughput, lag), structured logs, 
and distributed tracing to quickly identify any bottleneck.

9. How would you implement a resilient microservices architecture using Java? <br>
   Describe the standards you would use to ensure high availability.    

Every system fails. It’s something inevitable!<br>
I design microservices to fail gracefully. <br>
Using Java with Resilience4j!<br>
- I apply circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads, timeouts and fallbacks for each outbound call. 
- I keep services stateless, idempotent, and event-driven. 
- Data uses multi-AZ replicas and the Outbox pattern for consistency. 
- Kubernetes ensures health checks, autoscaling, and safe deployments through blue/green or canary rollout. 
- Observability is built in with metrics, logs, and distributed tracing. 

- The combination of these patterns delivers a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture.

10. Em um sistema de microserviços, como você lidaria com transações distribuídas que envolvem múltiplos serviços 
e bases de dados?
In microservices, I avoid classic distributed transactions like 2PC (which creates a single point of failure) 
because they don’t scale and create strong coupling between services.<br>
Instead, I rely on local transactions inside each service and coordinate the overall flow using events 
and compensations, following the Saga pattern.

I usually apply Sagas in two ways:

- Choreography: each service performs its local transaction and publishes an event; the next services react to that event. If something fails, an error event triggers the compensating actions.

- Orchestration: a central orchestrator calls each service in sequence and triggers compensations when needed.

To make this reliable, I ensure:
- Idempotency, so a service can process the same event multiple times without breaking the state.
- The Outbox Pattern, to avoid losing events between the database and the message broker.
- Retries and DLQs, to handle temporary and permanent failures.
- Observability, using correlationId to trace the entire “transaction” across services.

This way, I maintain consistency, low coupling, and resilience across the system—without relying 
on heavy distributed transactions.
---

11. How would you approach implementing a feature that requires high performance and needs to process large volumes 
of data in real time?

A solution needs to be available, scalable, performant, and resilient.

- performance: So the first step is understanding what “real-time high performance” actually means in that context: <br>
the acceptable latency, the data volume per second, the expected SLAs, and the tolerable error rate.

- async: After that, I would design an event-driven architecture to avoid the system getting stuck on slow 
or synchronous operations. <br>
I’d use something like Kafka to ingest and partition the data, allowing multiple consumers to process 
everything in parallel and scale horizontally as the load increases.

- code: In the code itself, I’d focus on fast, asynchronous processing: avoiding blocking operations, 
using batching when it makes sense, and relying on caching (like Redis) for frequently accessed data. <br>
The idea is to keep the critical path as light as possible — without unnecessary remote calls 
that slow down the response.

- observability: To ensure real performance, I’d add observability from the start: latency metrics, throughput, queue size, 
CPU and memory usage, and error rate. With these metrics, I’d run load and stress tests to tune thread counts, 
batch sizes, partitioning strategy, and the number of instances.

- scalable: Finally, I’d make sure the solution can scale horizontally in an elastic environment like Kubernetes, 
and I’d implement backpressure, retry mechanisms, and a DLQ, so the system keeps running smoothly 
even during unexpected spikes.

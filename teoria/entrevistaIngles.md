- introduction
   "Is it okay if I start now? First of all, thank you for this opportunity.
   I'm looking forward to discussing my experiences as a software developer.
   Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.

   I have a passion for solving complex problems, troubleshooting issues,
   and devising solutions efficiently.
   Due to this passion, I am seeking a position where I can apply my extensive experience.

   I'd like to emphasize that my expertise extends beyond being a Java developer.
   I have also worked extensively with Kotlin and Dart, particularly in backend development.

   In addition to my backend skills, I have experience in frontend development,
   allowing me to understand and contribute to the full spectrum of software development projects."

- Personal Life
   Hi, my name is Carlos. I'm 47 years old, married, and I have two daughters.
   I currently live in Itajaí, a large coastal city in the south of Brazil, in the state of Santa Catarina.
   In my free time, I enjoy going to the beach, exploring new places, and spending time with my family. 
   Cycling is my favorite sport — it's how I relax and recharge.

- Academic Background
   I have a degree in Software Engineering and I’m always looking to improve myself.
   I recently completed a postgraduate course in the same field, which helped me deepen my knowledge of system architecture, design patterns, and modern software practices.

- Professional Experience
   I’ve been working as a backend developer for many years, primarily using Java and Kotlin.
   Most of my experience is with companies in the financial, retail, and insurance sectors — including big names like Sicredi, Bradesco, and Coca-Cola FEMSA.
   Currently, I’m working as a Tech Lead in a microservices environment, helping teams deliver high-quality backend systems in Java.

- Relevant Projects
   One of the most impactful projects I worked on was a leads capture and distribution system that integrates with Salesforce.
   We used Kafka for messaging, AWS for infrastructure, and designed the whole solution using hexagonal architecture.
   It was a challenge that involved multiple teams and a high volume of daily transactions.

- Technical Skills
   I have strong skills in Java (17+), Kotlin, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka, RabbitMQ, REST APIs, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Git, and PostgreSQL/Oracle.
   I also follow clean code principles, SOLID, and I’m used to working with TDD, JUnit 5, Mockito, and CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
   Observability is another area I care about — I’m experienced with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, and JaCoCo.

- Challenges Faced
   One of the biggest challenges I’ve faced was leading a migration from a monolithic system to microservices, while ensuring data consistency, resilience, and minimal downtime.
   This involved mentoring the team, choosing the right technologies, and aligning with business goals — all under tight deadlines.

- Teamwork
   I truly believe in collaboration. Throughout my career, I’ve worked in Agile teams using Scrum or Kanban.
   I enjoy helping junior developers grow, discussing solutions with architects, and ensuring alignment across squads.
   For me, good communication and mutual respect are the key to a healthy and productive work environment.

- Career Goals
   My main goal is to keep growing as a software architect and help teams build scalable and maintainable systems.
   I’m also passionate about knowledge sharing — mentoring, writing documentation, and improving engineering practices.

- Why Do You Want to Work Here?
   I’ve been following your company for a while and I admire the way you invest in technology and innovation.
   I believe I can contribute with my experience and learn a lot by being part of a team that values quality, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

- What Do You Know About the Company?
    From what I’ve researched, your company is known for delivering high-impact digital solutions and working on projects that really make a difference in people’s lives.
    I’ve also seen that you value diversity, technical excellence, and long-term vision — and these are values that I share.

- Agradecendo o tempo do entrevistador
    Thank you very much for your time and the opportunity to discuss my background and experience.
    I’m excited about the possibility of contributing to your team and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

- Nao tenho praticado muito o ingles ultimamente...
    I have to admit that I haven’t been practicing my English as much as I would like lately.
    However, I’m committed to improving it and I’m actively working on it through courses, reading technical articles, and engaging in conversations like this one.
    I believe that strong communication skills are essential in today’s global work environment, and I’m eager to enhance mine.

- Ja teve alguma experiencia trabalhando em um ambiente internacional?
    Yes, I have. In one of my previous roles, I had the opportunity to collaborate with international teams, particularly from the US and Europe.
    This experience taught me how to work effectively across different time zones, communicate clearly despite cultural differences, and adapt to various working styles.

    I used to prepare regular activity reports for a colleague based in London. Over time, we developed a great professional relationship.
    Interestingly, when I visited London, I passed by her neighborhood — Alexandra Palace — and it made our connection even more meaningful.
    
    I really enjoy this kind of cultural exchange. It brings new perspectives, improves collaboration, and helps build stronger, more diverse teams.

- Como voce lida com a barreira do idioma?
    já passei por muitas coisas na minha carreira, e a barreira do idioma é apenas mais um desafio a ser superado.

- qual seu trabalho atual? fale um pouco sobre ele.
    Currently, I work at PagSeguro in a backend squad. I'm a Senior Java Developer. 
    I have three other backend teammates — so it's a backend-only team.
        We manage around ten microservices. Interestingly, all of them are written in Kotlin, which is something unique to our squad. But in the company overall, Java is the standard, and that's actually the language I feel most comfortable with. Still, I work with Kotlin smoothly on the backend.
        Our services communicate asynchronously, and we use Kafka for messaging. A specific detail is that we use Apache Avro as the communication protocol between systems.
        We run our applications in both AWS and a private cloud called PagCloud. I help manage deployments in both environments, and in PagCloud, everything runs on Kubernetes.
        We also use Jenkins for our CI pipelines. And of course, I have experience with other technical tools and practices as well.
        That’s a bit about what I’ve been working on lately.

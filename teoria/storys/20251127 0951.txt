The Developer and the Brand New Feature That Suddenly Broke Everything

Carla had just finished implementing a brand new feature in the payments-service.
It was a simple enhancement: add a new endpoint to retrieve transaction limits for customers.

She deployed it to the QA Kubernetes cluster and watched the pod start:

payments-service-7c9d...  1/1  Running


Everything looked perfect.

But suddenly, alerts started firing.

QA reported:

“Carla, the /limits endpoint is returning 500. Production is okay, but QA is failing.”

Carla opened the logs:

ERROR Failed to bind properties: prefix=limits


She frowned.

“Why would this break in QA but not in PROD?”

Her tech lead walked by and said:

“Carla, it’s up to you to figure out what’s going on.
You built the feature, you know it better than anyone.”

Challenge accepted.

Carla pulled the configs from QA and instantly noticed something strange.
In application-qa.yml, the configuration block looked like this:

limit:
  daily: 2000
  monthly: 10000


But in the brand new feature she had created, the prefix was:

limits:
  daily: 2000
  monthly: 10000


One letter.
Just one letter — and Spring Boot failed to bind the properties.

She smiled.

“I think I figured out the root cause,” she said to herself.

Carla fixed the file, redeployed the service, and watched the health checks turn green again.

QA tested the endpoint:

{
  "dailyLimit": 2000,
  "monthlyLimit": 10000
}


Everything worked.

She updated the ticket:

“Issue resolved. Incorrect configuration prefix in QA (limit vs limits).
Fixed and redeployed. The feature now works as expected.”

Her tech lead replied:

“Great job. You figured it out quickly.”

Carla leaned back in her chair, proud.
In the world of Spring and Kubernetes, sometimes all it takes is one tiny detail —
and it’s up to you to find it.
